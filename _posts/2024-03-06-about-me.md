Hello! I'm Anderson Fitch, a graduate student at the University of Florida working with Peter Kvam in the Cognition and Decision Modeling Lab. I use equations that instantiate psychological theories to understand the cognitive processes that contribute to behavior. My research focuses on the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence -- exploring how people make decisions, how AI makes decisions, and what we understand about each other.


Looks like you want to know a bit more about me! I'm from Manhattan -- not the big one in NYC -- the small one in, Kansas. I received my undergraduate degree in Psychology at Kansas State University in my hometown. After graduating, I moved to Gainesville to work under Dr. Peter Kvam at the University of Florida. I earned my Master's degree in 2023 and aim to finish my doctorate in May 2026.

During my free time, you'll find me playing disc golf, trying new food, or grinding out the hardest level of a videogame. In the evenings I spend some time pampering my cat Tuna and watching the latest drama with my partner Grace.
